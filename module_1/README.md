Approach: 

styles.css- set the style settings in html

__init__.py
The main Flask application that runs the portfolio website using blueprint.

pages.py
Sets the pages of the website: home, contact, and projects.

_navigation.html
Navigation pane for shifting pages.

base.html
A shared layout template that contains the navigation bar, background styling, and footer. All other pages extend this file to maintain a consistent design.

home.html
The home page of the portfolio. It introduces you, displays the copy-email button, and sets the tone of the site with the pastel background and styling.

projects.html
The projects showcase page. It dynamically generates a table of contents at the top and provides detailed sections with GitHub links for each project.

contact.html
A simple contact page (or section) that allows visitors to find your email and reach out. It integrates with the interactive copy-to-clipboard button for convenience.

references: I used the readings and lecture notes, as well as the documentation from real-python for setting up a Flask website.
